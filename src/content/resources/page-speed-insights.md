### What's it?

PageSpeed Insights is a performance analysis tool by Google. It helps web developers by analyzing the content of a web page and generating suggestions to make it load faster.

---

### How it works

PageSpeed Insights uses a variety of data to evaluate the performance of a website, including:

- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Speed Index (SI)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

These metrics help developers understand how quickly users are able to see and interact with content.

### How to use it

To use PageSpeed Insights:

1. Go to [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
2. Enter the URL of the webpage you want to analyze
3. Click "Analyze"

The tool will then produce a report with a score from 0-100, where higher scores indicate better performance, and suggestions for improvement.

Please note: PageSpeed Insights provides performance metrics for both mobile and desktop, as the loading speed can vary greatly between the two.
