### Using the Tabs

- Simplify your searches by using tabs to narrow down your results. For instance, you can specifically search for images, news, or books.

```
Python News
CSS Images
JavaScript Books
```

### Using Quotes for Exact Search

- Use quotes to find exact matches of phrases or sentences.

```
"Climate Change Effects"
"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald"
"Photosynthesis Process"
```

### Using Hyphen to Exclude Words

- Use a hyphen before a word to exclude it from your search.

```
Lion -King
Python -Snake
Mercury -Planet
```

### Searching Within a Specific Site

- Use a colon followed by a site name to search within that specific site.

```
Machine Learning site:mit.edu
Global Warming site:nytimes.com
COVID-19 Vaccination site:who.int
```

### Using the Asterisk Wildcard

- Use an asterisk as a placeholder for unknown or wildcard terms.

```
Be the _ you wish to see in the _
A _ saved is a _ earned
```

### Using Google Search for Math

- Perform mathematical operations directly in the search bar.

```
100 / 5
sqrt(16)
sin(30 degrees)
```

### Searching a Range of Numbers

- Use two dots between numbers to search within a range of numbers.

```
Samsung TV 32..65
Laptop $500..$1000
Calories in burger 300..500
```

### Using Shortcuts for Instant Results

- Use shortcut commands for quick results.

```
Time in Tokyo
Weather New York
Saudi Riyal to USD
```

### Searching for a Specific File Type

- Search for a specific file type by using 'filetype:' followed by the file extension.

```
Global Warming filetype:pdf
Machine Learning filetype:ppt
Budget Planning filetype:xls
```

### Money and Unit Conversions

- Use Google search for quick conversions between different units or currencies.

```
5km to miles
100 USD to EUR
50 Celsius to Fahrenheit
```
